    "# Static Voting Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout the chapter we will use the following notation:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- We will consider an abstract economy consisting of a finite set of individuals $\\mathcal{H}$, with the number of individuals denoted by $H$.\n",
    "- $p$ denotes the vector of political choices (for example, institutions, policies or other collective choices), with the menu\n",
    "of policies denoted by $\\mathcal{P}$.\n",
    "- We note the *indirect utility function* defined over policy as $U (p; α_i)$. It sets the utility of policy $p$ for individual $i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "A political system will then aggregate the individual preferences $U(p, \\alpha_i)$ into social welfare function $U^S(p)$, which ranks the policies for the society.\n",

    "## Arrow's Theorem\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we will have a look into Arrow's theorem. For Arrow's theorem, we assume that the setof feasible policies, $\\mathcal{P}$, is finite and is a subset of the Euclidean space, that is, $\\mathcal{P}\\in \\mathbb{R}^{k}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To visualize the theorem, we will use a simple example of voting. A team of 5 people is voting on 3 options. The option are actually just the dates for a christmas party. The team members are Alice, Bob, Charlie, David and Eve. The options are the 10th, 11th and 12th of December. Each team member has a preference for the dates. \n",
    "\n",
    "The team members really want this vote to be fair. So what is a fair vote? The team members agree that the following properties are important:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. *Unrestricted domain* - The voting system should be able to handle any possible preference profile.\n",
    "2. *Unanimity* - If all team members prefer the 10th over the 12th, then the group should prefer 10th over the 12th.\n",
    "3. *Independence of irrelevant alternatives* - The group's preference between two options should not depend on the preferences between other options.\n",
    "4. *Non-dictatorship* - There should not be a single team member that can always determine the group's preference. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is fairly remarkable that Arrow's theorem states that it is impossible to design a voting system that satisfies all these properties. In this notebook, we will visualize this theorem by looking at the preferences of the team members and the group's preference."
