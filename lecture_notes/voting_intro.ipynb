    "# Voting\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we will have a look into Arrow's theorem. To visualize the theorem, we will use a simple example of voting. A team of 5 people is voting on 3 options. The option are actually just the dates for a christmas party. The team members are Alice, Bob, Charlie, David and Eve. The options are the 10th, 11th and 12th of December. Each team member has a preference for the dates. \n",
    "\n",
    "The team members really want this vote to be fair. So what is a fair vote? The team members agree that the following properties are important:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. *Unrestricted domain* - The voting system should be able to handle any possible preference profile.\n",
    "2. *Unanimity* - If all team members prefer the 10th over the 12th, then the group should prefer 10th over the 12th.\n",
    "3. *Independence of irrelevant alternatives* - The group's preference between two options should not depend on the preferences between other options.\n",
    "4. *Non-dictatorship* - There should not be a single team member that can always determine the group's preference. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is fairly remarkable that Arrow's theorem states that it is impossible to design a voting system that satisfies all these properties. In this notebook, we will visualize this theorem by looking at the preferences of the team members and the group's preference."
